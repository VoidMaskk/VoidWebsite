            As you can see, this is my very own website, I think you probably know me as the most <br>
            annoying guy in the Discord server (<i>Onge & Cery: The Great Alliance</i>), if you don't know me from there, you should <br>
            definitely join that Discord server, it's a 11/10 server. <br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            So, here's what this website is about: <br>
            <br>
            This is a website where I basically write logs on things I do (mostly programming things) and <br>
            advertise some of my favourite Discord servers, Minecraft things...
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2 style="text-align:center;"><b>Entry N1:</b></h2> <br>
        <p>
            I made a 250 GB zip bomb that occupies 1.5 MB while zipped. <br>

        <img src="./ASSETS/FakeAdvertisements/ONGEANDCERY1.png" alt="You should join Onge & Cery NOW!" width="175" height="350" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <br>

        <br>
        <h2 style="text-align:center;"><b>Entry N2:</b></h2>
        <p>
            I have decided to learn more CSS to style this website and possibly <br>
            learn more things that I can share with my friends.
